## üîê The developer-centric DevSecOps solution for production data access

OpsGate aims to provide secure access to production databases without impairing developer productivity.

Utilizing the Four-Eyes Principle and a high level of configurability, OpsGate allows a Pull Request-like Review and Approval flow for individual Database statements or full Database sessions.

OpsGate is a self hosted solution, this is a deliberate design decision as you shouldn't have to expose your databases to any external party. However we try to make it a simple as possible to get set up.

Initially we will focus on PostgreSQL and MySQL support.
