## Explanation of the licensing situation

The idea of reserving some code as not licensed is to allow for a paid version of Kviklet. You can acquire the right to use the code by paying for Kviklet Enterprise. This requires a separate license agreement.

In the software this will be handled via a license key. Without this key, you are running the MIT licensed version of Kviklet.
