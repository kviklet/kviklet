## End to End Tests

This folder contains our e2e test suite, written with playwright.
The playwright docs are pretty good so use them as your reference: https://playwright.dev/docs/intro

## Quickstart:

- If node not installed install it with nvm: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
- Run `npm install`
- To run the tests run `npx playwright test` or `npx playwright test --ui` for the UI.
- Highly recommend to install the VSCode extension: https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode (makes a lot of things easier, like running individual tests or recording your own)
